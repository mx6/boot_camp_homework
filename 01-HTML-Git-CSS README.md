01-HTML-Git-CSS homework, Week 1.

I corrected the anchor tag for "search engine optimization".  I added a title that best described the page, and the "company's" stated purpose.  I simplified style.css by combining similar/redundant code.  I added alt/title tags and info for accessibility.  I cleaned up the html to improve readability and searchability.
